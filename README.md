# Library-app-Python
Library is a app where user can add books, view the saved books, search for the book exists in the database, delete any entry of the book,
they can also add books and update the book list. There are four fields to fill for adding books or update. This app is build with python 
using Tkinter. there are two script one is for fontend and another is backend. In frontend I use Tkinter to design the app and connect with
the database and listener for the commands. And backend script I use sqlite3 that comes autometically with the python I just import it no need
to install it.
